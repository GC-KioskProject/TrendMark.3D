# TrendMark.3D
Tendmark is a reaction time test that measures on many different spots this includes score, accuracy reaction time (in MS), and how many times you actually hit a Target. All of this allows you, the user, to improve and overall get better and train for any FPS, PVP, or any other fast combat game that you might be playing.
